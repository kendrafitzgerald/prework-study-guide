# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind creating this webpage was to build a study guide for full stack development bootcamp students to utilize. The web page contains pertinent information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript that was gathered by reading resources from both course modules and the internet. I built this project to learn basics of the languages previously mentioned, as well as to create a central location to store notes on the basics of these languages. The webpage solves the problem of creating a study guide to store the information I learned in the prework portion of the bootcamp. I learned throughout this process how to utilize aspects of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I also learned how to debug code, write code, and creating a functioning website. Overall, the webpage is a representation of what I learned in the prework of the course.

If you utilize the Chrome DevTools console by right clicking on the page, hitting Inspect, then Console, you can see the JavaScript running and a list of the topics on the page. You can use it to randomly select one topic to study first.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Creates structure of a web page</li>
          <li>Provides content and basic framework for all pages on the web</li>
          <li>Includes text, image, header, and list elements (types of content on a web page)</li>
          <li>HTML provides a sturdy frame to your web page</li>
          <li>HTML elements typically composed of opening tag or closing tag wihtin angle brackets, contain what we want to include in the element</li>
          <li>head element contains info (metadata) that helps browser to render the page correctly, not visible when user looks at webpage</li>
          <li>body elements contains content that is shown to the user, all elements we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this</li>
          <li>!DOCTYPE html declaration lets browser know they should expect HTML on the page</li>
          <li>html opening tag which shows the start of the HTML doc; attribute of lang=”en” tells browser the language for webpage</li>
          <li>HTML attributes defines additional info about an element</li>
          <li>head element contains metadata</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about the webpage that browser uses to effectively serve webpage to users</li>
          <li>title element is a metadata tag that defines title for the webpage</li>
          <li>style is the CSS styles associated; base defines base URL; link connects external resource to HTML doc; meta defines metadata like character set, description, keywords, author and viewport</li>
          <li>Script is client side scripts in the HTML doc</li>
          <li>Head element defines following elements
            Charset (character encoding)
            Http-equiv (sets an HTTP header for content)
            Viewport (sets default view for our webpage)</li>
            <li>Child elements are elements nested inside of other elements</li>
            <li>Parent element is element that child elements are inside of </li>
            <li>Body element defines body of document, holds content visible to user, all content we want to display must be inside of this</li>
            <li>body element is an example of a semantic HTML element</li>
            <li>Semantic HTML elements, name of element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage; make HTML easier to read by other developers and browser</li>
            <li>Non semantic elements div creates division in the page, span creates an inline division</li>
            <li>Opening tags and closing tags, have the angle brackets, closing tags begin with a forward slash after first angle bracket</li>
            <li>Elements are entire element from opening tag to closing tag; tag is only what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
            <li>Headings are represented by h1, h2 etc, and represent larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page</li>
            <li>p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
            <li>ul=unordered list, ol=ordered list, li= list items (bulleted or numbered lists), ul contains an unordered bulleted list</li>
            <li>img contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage, can contain attributes like src which defines location of the image</li>
            <li>Alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image</li>
            <li>Br element creates line break between two blocks of content</li>
            <li>a stands for anchor, creates linked to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
            <li>Href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
            <li>Footer element goes at end of page, usually includes copyright and things like that</li>
            <li>section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
            <li>id and class are used to identify and select elements</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> Used to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
            <li>Defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
            <li>Three types of styles: Inline, internal, external</li>
            <li>Inline CSS are used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
            <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only; useful for quick and permanent changes but not as flexible as external and internal style sheets (must be edited individually)</li>
            <li>Inline CSS- style attribute to change color of h1 heading</li>
            <li>Internal style sheet can be embedded directly into the HTML file, contains CSS rules for the webpage, rules only apply to that one page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs to identify elements and style multiple elements in the page code</li>
            <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements </li>
            <li>External CSS style sheet is most common way to style a website</li>
            <li>External CSS style sheets allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a separate file which makes design changes easier</li>
            <li>When using external style sheet, the file is linked using a link element placed in the HTMLs head (header)</li>
            <li>CSS Rule: selector defines the element or attributes to which the declarations apply</li>
            <li>Declarations contain two important components: CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
            <li>Example: the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value of that property, blue</li>
            <li>Margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element, not visible on page, adds a buffer, margin and 0 means no extra space</li>
            <li>Padding property adds space around the content inside an element, increasing padding makes the entire element bigger because it is located inside an element </li>
            <li>CSS box model: margins outside the element, elements borders, padding, and content </li>
            <li>Asterisk will apply a rule to all elements visible on page</li>
            <li>DRY (do not repeat yourself) Code is a principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines that need to be written or maintained: example is header, footer selectors with same declaration</li>
            <li>Text align is a position property, can center a title or heading on a webpage </li>
            <li>CSS rules can be applied to images as well, img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
            <li>Display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line</li>
            <li>Link is needed to connect stylesheet to HTML, place it after final meta element in head, and before title element</li>
            <li>The Rel attribute in the link specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the URL of the external resource, it is using a relative path which means the location is derived from the current location, and to locate the style sheet from the current location of index.html we need to look in assets folder</li>
            <li>Class attributes allow you to share a CSS rule to any element of choice by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector; CA can be assigned to element in HTML and we can freely choose which elements are assigned the CSS rule</li>
            <li>Adding a period before the card selector designates card as a class selector, any HTML element assigned to class card will gain these properties</li>
            <li>HTML has color codes you can assign in CSS either by using semantic references or a hex # or hexadecimal code that is on HTML color codes website</li>

              <h2>JavaScript</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
                <li>In JS, to declare a variable we use the var keyword</li>
                <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a name</li>
                <li>This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the info stored in the variable in our code </li>
                <li>We use an assignment operator, =, to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable, like var shape = circle, with circle in quotes</li>
                <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks, and each line of JS code ends with a semicolon</li>
                <li>console.log() method is used to output a message to the web console by adding an argument </li>
                <li>In the prework study guide, console log outputs the value of topics because we have added it as an argument inside the parantheses</li>
                <li>The world console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code</li>
                <li>The second part, is a method which is a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer and will output whatever we add inside the paraantheses to the console</li>
                <li>JS files are linked within the body element, after the footer</li>
                <li>Chrome Dev Tools allow you to see the console, by right clicking on the page and then choosing inspect, then console, which allows us to see the console log method in action that helps developers test and debug code</li>
                <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
                <li>In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page</li>
                <li>For example, the topics must be defined before we tell our computer how to log them</li>
                <li>Control flow can be interrupted, using conditional statements and loops can let us alter control flow</li>
                <li>Conditional if statements are a a way of introducing decision making into our code</li>
                <li>The code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or if it is true</li>
                <li>When a computer encounters an if statement in a JS file, it will check to see if the condition we provide is truthy</li>
                <li>If the condition is truthy, the action in between the curly bracakets will be completed</li>
                <li>If the condition has a value that is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on</li>
                <li>A value is falsy if it is: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NotaNumber, or a Boolean data type with a value of false</li>
                <li>A value is truthy if it is any other value, or a Boolean data type with the value of true</li>
                <li>A conditional else if statement means that the computer will continue through all conditions we provide, and evaluate whether or not a condition is truthy</li>
                <li>Once it finds that a condition is truthy, it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, and then break out of the if statement</li>
                <li>=== is the strict equality operator and checks to see if the two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal, and false if the calues are not equal</li>
                <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
                <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item</li>
                <li>We use var, then give the variable a naame, and assign the variable to a group of values</li>
                <li>Arrays are useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once</li>
                <li>A single array can store different types of data, like strings or numbers so on and so forth</li>
                <li>To work with individual items inside an array, we need to have the location of the data item in the array, and this location is identified with a unique number called an index</li>
                <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential which means the first item is 0, not 1</li>
                <li>The indices, or location identifiers, are always whole numbers which increase by 1</li>
                <li>There are several types of loops</li>
                <li>Forloops use the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
                <li>Another statement, such as the conditional if statement, interrupts the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times </li>
                <li>Using a forloop, the computer will go through each of the items in our array and log them into the console until there are none left</li>
                <li>We need the index and the array's length to do so</li>
                <li>The array length is important because the forloop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array</li>
                <li>You can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, called the length</li>
                <li>There are three important statements in a forloop as listed below</li>
                <li>THe first statement determines the starting point for our loop, so if we want it to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable and give it the value of 0 </li>
                <li>The second statement is the condition, as long as the number in the variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running which allows the loop to execute one time for each item in the array, and we use the length property on the array to express that condition</li>
                <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item</li>
                <li>Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1, now whenever the code loops, x will increase by 1 as shown in the following line of code</li>
                <li>A forloop starts with for, then the code we want to be executed for each loop goes inside of the curly brackets</li>
                <li>A function, at the most basic level, is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
                <li>A function is different than a forloop or conditional statement because they do not automatically execute when a JS file is run</li>
                <li>A function must be called by name to execute, and it makes the code more easily reusable because you can call it as many times as you need</li>
                <li>Being able to call a function also means you have control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all</li>
                <li>Essentially, a function groups a set of instructions</li>
                <li>The first part of a function is defining the function</li>
                <li>Function declaration uses the function keyword to define the function</li>
                <li>The code block, or function body, is where we write out instructions for what the function will do and it is inside curly brackets</li>
                <li>The second part of a function is calling the function</li>
                <li>To call the function, the function name first must be followed by parantheses</li>
                <li>To call the function name, write the function name () where you want it to be called in the code and we will see the instructions put out</li>
                <li>Example of a function in Google Docs notes </li>
                <li>When we want to randomize selection from the array, we need to use a Math function that helps us select a random number</li>
                <li>this function is Math.random() and Math.floor() and is placed after our variable name</li>
                <li>Remember, an array must be defined before we do our functions</li>
                <li>More detailed JS notes from articles are in Google Docs</li>
